# Description:
An inventory and interaction system created with Godot engine, inspired by classic point and click games. The inventory system is from my previous project, which you can find here: https://github.com/EveningStar05/Inventory-System
An icon will show up if players gets close to certain items in the world, showing that players can interact with that item and can get:
    • add item to inventory.
    • signpost: get a description of the item that players interacted with.
