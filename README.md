# Description:

An inventory and interaction system created with Godot engine, inspired by classic point and click games. The inventory system is from my previous project, which you can find here:Â https://github.com/EveningStar05/Inventory-System

An icon will show up if players gets close to certain items in the world, showing that players can interact with that item and can do:

- add item to inventory.
- signposting: get a description of the item that players interacted with.
