## Description:

This is an inventory and interaction system created with Godot engine, inspired by classic point and click games. The inventory system is from my previous project, which you can find here:Â https://github.com/EveningStar05/Inventory-System

In this project I used Area2d for the interactions. Players can interact with items in the world, an icon will show up if the Player gets close enough to the item. 
Performing 2 actions:
- add item to inventory: a plus icon will show up on top of the item, indicating that it is a pickable item.
- signpost: a search icon will show up, if you click it a dialog will show up giving what the character thought of the item. (You can play around with the item description in json file.)
